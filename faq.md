## Minecraft

### when will you update *x*?
please understand, i always get to it as soon as i can!

however, i am still human...
little birbs may get everything they need to do birb things from just the environment,
but i don't. things can (and often do) get in the way.

and even if i'm not particularly busy, the stock of my mental health is very limited.
honestly, it's lucky i haven't given up yet... please be patient, i'm trying.

### can i use your mod in my modpack?
yes - you don't need to ask authors for permission for CurseForge and Modrinth modpacks!

<p style="text-align: center;">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>

### can i commission you?
i didn't use to formally do commissions, but i am open to the possibility now - feel free to message me about it on Discord!

### can i use your datapack in my modpack?
in the form of a mod - yes, absolutely!

if for whatever reason that's not possible, then you're free to include the datapack as well.
though i prefer you use the mod version because i get to keep the revenue! ðŸ¥º

<p style="text-align: center;">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>

### can i use your resource pack in my modpack?
of course! try to include it the standard way (the same way you would a mod) and try not to combine packs into one
unless it's absolutely necessary and there's no other way to achieve your goal.

<p style="text-align: center;">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>

### can i use assets from your resource pack in my own pack that i'm going to publish?
if other creators' assets (including mine) don't form a majority or substantial part of your pack,
that is **most of the pack is your own creation** - you can,
but please credit me. (and any other creators whose work you use)

however, i don't use others' assets in my packs, so... you probably shouldn't either?

### can i use your datapacks to learn worldgen and other things?
of course you can, that's a silly question. and you should - datapacking is fun,
and we learn best from each other! have fun!
