Tiniercode is a tiny, modern, universal bitmap font. The font height is a mere 6 pixels, making it great for tiny
resolutions while remaining fully legible.

This font supports all letters and common characters of the English alphabet. Due to its tiny size diacritics are
unsupported.

This font was made for use in game dev, but feel free to use it anywhere! For programs like Aseprite, or anywhere
where rendering is down to individual pixels, the smallest usable font size is 8, and so this font scales
perfectly to 16, 24, 32, etc.
