title: "On supporting JK Rowling (and a timeline of her hate)"

this post is an addendum to my previous post about queer hate on the internet.
if you haven't read that, it might be worth doing that first, but i suppose you don't have to.
this addition somehow ended up taking even more effort than the original post, as
it was originally meant to just be my moral argument,
but i just felt it was incomplete without some factual groundwork to build on top of.

in that post i mentioned a very particular British fiction author and their contributions
to the rise in hate and violence against trans people.
believe it or not, i was referring to JK Rowling.

if you've been around on the internet as of late,
or around LGBT folks in real life,
you're most likely aware there are people out there
who argue for disassociating from JK Rowling and her work.
i sympathise with that stance, but
want to give a breakdown of why,
as it seems not everyone is convinced.

really, what is shocking to me is not necessarily the sheer scale of her hate campaign,
but the fact that there are still people out there who support her and/or her work.
that wouldn't be at all surprising if those supporters happened to also be
hate-filled bigots, or perhaps converted hate-filled minions of hers,
but that isn't the case.
JK Rowling, to this day, is still very popular among not only self-proclaimed
allies of LGBT folks, but somehow, a few trans people as well.

all right... let's unpack that. because i feel like we have to.

on April 16 this year, the Supreme Court of the UK delivered a ruling on an extremely major human rights case,
which [Amnesty International called](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/uk-supreme-court-outcome-disappointing-court-affirms-right-trans-people-protection) "clearly disappointing," with "potentially concerning consequences for trans people."

the ruling did note that trans people are protected against discrimination for being trans,
but in essence (and i'm not a UK lawyer, so don't quote me on this) the ruling mainly established that trans women in the UK
were, in certain legal contexts, [not considered women, but men.](https://time.com/7278363/what-to-know-uk-supreme-court-transgender-women-ruling/)
this case was famously funded and supported to an extreme by Rowling,
who publicly [donated about $90,000](https://www.thepinknews.com/2024/02/19/jk-rowling-for-women-scotland-donation-legal-definition-woman/) of her wealth to the plaintiff.

in response to the ruling, the author posted a picture of herself smoking a cigar on board
of, presumably, [her 150-million-dollar private yacht.](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/celebrity-news/jk-rowling-celebrates-court-win-35074764) "i love it when a plan comes together," she commented.

a month after that (a couple of days after i started writing this)
Rowling announced her creation of a brilliant new charitable organization
so selflessly named "JK Rowling Women’s Fund."
the goal of this fund? obviously, the promotion of "women's sex-based rights,"
i.e. complete legal isolation of a certain minority from society.

that sounds pretty bad, but this is just the tip of the iceberg.
yes, it quite literally is. Rowling has worked hard for years dumping her toxic wastewater into
the sea to create this sharp, Titanic-ready glacier and it has a clear target - trans women.

**here's a timeline covering the most relevant events.**

in 2014, Rowling published the novel "The Silkworm," where
she includes a trans woman character whom she describes as having a "hideous voice."<br>
it is in the years following that she starts liking tweets
describing trans women as "strangers with penises," "men in dresses," and "sexual predators,"
sometimes acting like it was a mistake, likely still hesitant to damage her reputation.

in a way unsurprisingly, it was when the pandemic hit Rowling went truly off the rails,
fully and wholly publicly embracing and supporting the rhetoric that
trans women are primarily "male sexual predators."
she stamps the "transgender movement" as a movement whose main goal is supposedly "disguising predators,"
and suggests the only reason trans people exist is modern trends,
nevermind those two ideas not being entirely compatible.

in that same year she publishes the book "Troubled Blood," a book about a
villain who crossdresses as a woman to pray on women,
refering to the character's act as a ["careful performance of femininity."](https://www.vox.com/culture/21449215/troubled-blood-review-jk-rowling-transphobia-controversy)
not long after, she spoke out that "90%" of Harry Potter fans agree with her
on her "views."

as another example of her views,
in 2021, frustrated at the legal recognition of trans people, she tweets "The Penised Individual Who Raped You Is a Woman,"
tacking it on to 1984's dystopian quote "War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength,"
again labelling trans women (at first glance ones who haven't undergone gender reassignment surgery,
but in truth i highly doubt that in her mind she recognises there are trans women who have)
as sexual predators and rapists.

in 2022, Rowling [meets with the founder of the LGB Alliance](https://medium.com/@missfredawallace/jk-rowlings-bottomless-brunch-bcbfebe57cba),
a group dedicated to campaigning [against the rights of trans people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGB_Alliance) in the UK, among many things
opposing a ban on conversion therapy practices on trans people.
in that same meeting she also met with other people publicly known for crusading against
the rights of trans people,
and continues to attack and label trans women as sexual predators.

the same year, Rowling publishes yet another book titled "The Ink Black Heart,"
in which she depicts herself an artist [getting cancelled on the internet](https://www.npr.org/2022/08/31/1120299781/jk-rowling-new-book-the-ink-black-heart)
because of her "racist, ableist and transphobic cartoon" of a ["hermaphrodite worm,"](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/j-k-rowlings-latest-book-ink-black-heart-transphobic-views-1234582911/) whatever that means.
ultimately, her self-insert character ends up a victim of murder
due to her "righteous" views,
getting killed because of a hate campaign against her.

Rowling didn't get killed because of a hate campaign, but someone else did.
following the [murder of Brianna Ghey](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-67729418) only a few months after the release of this book,
a trans girl at only 16 years of age,
Rowling [tried to backpedal on her statements](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/jk-rowling-podcast-trans-harry-potter-comments-hogwarts-b2283266.html) saying she was merely "misunderstood,"
and that she "never set out to upset anyone."

just before claiming that, she [posted that she was](https://x.com/jk_rowling/status/1619302315248488450) "deeply amused by those telling me i’ve lost their admiration due to the disrespect i show violent, duplicitous rapists,"
at this point again clearly referring to trans women.
two months later, she claims, in the innocently named podcast "The Witch Trials of JK Rowling,"
that she believe  there is "something dangerous about [the trans] movement,"
before [comparing trans people to the Death Eaters](https://www.vox.com/culture/23622610/jk-rowling-transphobic-statements-timeline-history-controversy) from her Harry Potter franchise.

oh, and as far as protecting the "sex-based rights" of cisgender women goes,
to this day, Rowling [keeps attacking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1kxhk23/one_year_later_and_jk_rowling_is_still_harassing/) the Algerian boxer Imane Khelif,
a cisgender woman. what brought her case into the spotlight were the Russians
complaining about apparently elevated testosterone levels in Khelif's blood.
"i believe Khelif is a biological man," said Rowling in a tweet on the 29th May of this year.
"he failed sex testing."  
Khelif has been legally considered female since her birth
in her home country of Algeria, where being homosexual (and therefore by extent transgender)
is punishable by [imprisonment up to 2 years](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/15/algeria-mass-convictions-homosexuality).
if Khelif really was in any way trans, she'd be in prison.

there is a lot more i didn't cover here, this is just the tip of this iceberg.
Rowling is an active abuser of her Twitter account and has been for years,
constantly abusing and dehumanizing trans women either as a whole
or as individuals on Twitter.
she is a deeply flawed individual and a cruel abuser and manipulator,
doing her best to misuse everything, however cruel and unrelated,
in favour of her cause.
it is simply not feasable to cover it all,
and doing so would be a research feat.

i think it's beyond any reasonable doubt that what Rowling is doing is
cruel, evil and morally despicable.
however, it is still true that she is the author of the well-known and much beloved franchise
Harry Potter.

and look, i get it, you grew up with it.
but do you really feel that after everything i've listed
that it's still okay to like her work?
does it not feel a bit gross?
is it not foul to you that the same work that to you means your childhood, nostalgia, and comfort
now means suffering, trauma and abuse to others?
is it not crude that the same work was created by a person
whose entire life is now dedicated to a single cruel cause?
is it not revolting that the same work is the sole source
of funding for the suffering and persecution of innocent people?

no? or perhaps maybe, but you think it can't matter,
how could it matter, she created this work years back,
and you think that, clearly, it can't have anything to do with her today?

well, okay... i still do have one more thing.
i want to share a story about a similar experience of mine, if i can.

back when i was around 14, i had in my early teen life an online creator whose work, videos, i sincerely enjoyed.
and i mean i really did - they helped me a lot throughout bad times,
and back then, all the times were pretty bad.
the videos were kind and motivating,
always putting forth the premise that despite struggles,
there were things to look forward to.
they were my source of the feeling of a cosy blanket,
warm fireplace and a game of Catan with three good friends.
a feeling that everybody needs once in a while,
a feeling that is no less important to us than oxygen or sustenance.
unfortunately for me, not that much has changed in this regard even over the years,
and i still suffer from the same depression and chronic loneliness i suffered from then,
but back then, that was my source of comfort.
a very important source of support i so desperately needed.

now, i'm not going to say what the creator was called, because frankly, i don't really remember,
but i don't really feel like sharing that knowing now what he was about.

turns out he had kept one too many skeletons in his closet. allegations about domestic violence surfaced,
and they didn't seem made up. what's more, he didn't really try to counter them.
having learned of those charges,
and that there were in fact court proceedings against him,
i decided to drop watching him.

it was a shame since his videos were good, i thought at the time. but to me, it wasn't worth supporting
a creator whose work might have been all right, but whose actions made people around him suffer.
it wasn't even a decision, really - the feeling that i enjoy the work
of a person who is obviously not right was enough. i didn't need that in my life,
and the feeling of comfort from his work was lost.
it could not be revived.
i could not draw support from the work of a person whose actions abused the support of others.

then, moving on to JK Rowling - no doubt her work is influental.
however, after everything we've established - everything she is directly responsible for -

the completely unjustified suffering of innocent people at her hands,

her targeted abuse and harassment of a tiny minority of people,

her staunch legal efforts to actively persecute this tiny minority out of existence,

the fact there's no doubt that there are people out there who either already have or will commit suicide because of her hatred,

the fact her organised abuse has already resulted in victims of physical violence,

the fact the violence has in some cases already led to the loss of innocent life,

and lastly the fact she is actively happy about everything mentioned above,

if you're still a fan of JK Rowling's work, you need to accept this is what you're also indirectly supporting.

**there is no "separating the art from the artist."**
feel free to separate Hitler from his art, but he is dead.
Rowling, meanwhile, is laying in a pool of hate and abuse,
and by keeping her and her work in your mind and in the public's eye,
you're pumping even more water into it.
she would never be capable of such cruelty if she didn't have the cultural relevance she has today.

no single work of fiction should hold so much weight in your mind, in your identity, that you
cannot let it go even if the author is actively funding the persecution of innocent people,
especially if they're your people.

i have let go of things i used to love. and you should have the ability too.
letting go of such things is not a sign of disloyalty, but of emotional maturity.
and on top of that, at least to me, whose work i support matters just as much as what kind of person is behind it.
and for what it's worth: there are better things out there!
the world is full of amazing, talented creators, who are not nearly as morally despicable.
but you will never find them if you keep up this attitude.

think about it.

and if you consider yourself an ally of queer people,
and even after everything you still insist that you must remain a fan of Harry Potter,
that it is an integral part of your identity,
and that letting go is impossible,

you're an ally of nobody but yourself.

oh, and i've got a message for you too, JK...

know that like all of us, you too will one day wake up in your bed
ignorant of the fact it's your last day on this earth.
unfortunate enough, but unlike the people you so vehemently spend your
entire days fighting against, punishing for who they are and not for 
what they did to you (not that then it would be excusable) you will
wake up alone, with the sole semblance of any kind of support in your life
being the hatred you have sown and the people you turned 
rageful against a straw man threat.

there will not be an ounce left of care for you or your wellbeing,
for it was all consumed by the pitch-black crevice you've dug.
on this last day you will stay ignorant of the fact your passing
will not be mourned by loving people,
and will only be mourned for a short while by people you so willingly made hateful,
for they will immediately transform this energy into the spite you programmed
into them.

what will follow will not be sorrow nor joy,
grief nor celebration,
but utter unconcern at your sad fate,
for the desolation you have caused is beyond measure
and any more diversion of attention in your direction
will be viewed as utterly pointless and counterproductive by either side.
the malicious cause you've birthed with your efforts
will move on without you for the machine of destruction really only needs to burn
its creator's body as fuel to keep its wheels turning.
and with you will burn your creative legacy and all vague good you might have
done in the fiery furnace of cruel machinery entirely of your making.

did you not feel like you had done enough?
did you not feel that there was any joy to be derived from your creation?
did you feel that children's joy was not an honour to be content at?
did you feel empty after the art of creation,
and only felt full after the sin of destruction?
did you only feel content when people suffered and perished
at your hands?
did you only feel content when you heard the screams of people ran over by your machine of cruelty?
and do you still feel content now that you know all you are today is fuel 
to a creation you hold no control over?

but once it runs out of fuel there will be nothing left.
what's left of you and your legacy will be consumed by the pitch-black crevice,
and you will forever fade into oblivion,
with your name becoming one that will not be spoken again with a loving tone,
until inevitably society heals and your crevice will be
filled with dirt and on top will grow a beautiful garden dedicated
to the trans people whose lives were lost at the hands of your malice.
