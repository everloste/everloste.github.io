title: "On the hatred towards queer people (and trans people especially) and what we should be doing about it"

this is a post where i voice my view on the extreme rise in hatred towards queer people on the internet (as well as in real life)
and what i think we should really be doing about it as the perhaps better side of the internet community.

it's also my argument for why we maybe shouldn't be entertaining any more
discussions about the rights of queer people,
but instead should be protecting their safe spaces until things get better.

i know this isn't what i usually do, and this was originally meant to be about privacy on the web, but as i kept writing, it evolved into a different text
entirely. i might write about privacy some other day, but i feel like hate is now more relevant than anything else,
and cannot be tolerated any longer.

it's 2025, and it's impossible to go on Twitter (rest in peace, i guess?), Bluesky, Reddit, or whatever
other social media there is, without stumbling into a post deliberating on and about queer people within minutes, sometimes even seconds.

depending on which social media it is, the post is bound to either be simply a classic of hate and fascist rhetoric,
or a thread of, and this is in my experience most common, "rational" reactions dividing the population
"objectively," by sexuality, "biological sex" and "gender identity," often unknowingly (or very knowingly) adopting much of the fascist rhetoric,
dismissing or vilifying the existence of entire subgroups of queer people.

to me it's kind of terrifying that it's gotten to this point.
i do not remember the internet of just 5 years ago being this incredibly obsessed with such a tiny minority group
of vulnerable people. if you wanted queer topics, you had to go to r/lgbt, other subreddits, or the classic, Tumblr, which
to this day has a pastime of banning innocent trans women from the site.
regardless, by my memory, it was rarely a matter of the front page.

in my memory, and perhaps one of the oldest of my memories regarding this topic, (and this was depressingly many years ago now)
was that of a poor woman with a trans pride flag in her profile picture leaving an ordinary comment under a YouTube video,
and receiving an awful response by some random asshole commenter with cruel copypasta in detail describing how she "wasn't a real woman" and how she should end her life.
i really hope she is doing ok now. i really do.

i don't know when exactly it started, but in my mind, 2022 was the year the floodgates truly broke.
it was the year of two terrorist attacks in Europe which specifically targeted queer people -
one in [Oslo, Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Oslo_shooting) and one in [Bratislava, Slovakia](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/slovak-pm-condemns-shooting-that-killed-two-outside-gay-bar-2022-10-13/). a total of 4 LGBT people lost their lives.

both terrorists, the former an islamist and the latter a neo-nazi, had a history of pushing hateful narratives about LGBT people
on the internet, as well as calling for their genocide.  
the latter's own manifesto included much of the rhetoric used by
mainstream conservative political parties around the west, whether the GOP, the Tories, the AfD, Fidesz...
which primarily pushes the absurd idea that LGBT folks (among other groups) "erode traditional family values" and are thus "destroying the west."

and no, he also wasn't in any way a loner, one-off extremist.
even though this idea is a popular rhetorical tactic used by the people on the far right of the political spectrum
to distance themselves from the obviously terrifying acts of violence,
these people are still a vital part of the vast undercurrent of extreme homophobia and transphobia in the sea of the political internet.
the terrorist merely acted in the way he knew these people would love,
and he admitted this.  
his motivation came *primarily* from the support of his peers,
and mainstream hatred towards the minorities.
the same, while many mainstream conservatives did pretend to condemn this act,
they still immediately afterwards hijacked the opportunity to further try and demonise the victims of these terrorist attacks.

anyway, while it might not have been the main catalyst, 2022 might still have been the year the topic of queer people
truly entered the mainstream.
for one, that year absolutely invoked reactions of empathy and calls for the expansion of rights of queer people,
but it also permanently put that gay nugget into many people's brains.

and it's only gone downhill since. and part of me shivers when i realise this was indeed the terrorists' goal.

i have been on the internet long enough to see that attacks on queer people have always been beyond common,
and that they make the best targets. the cruelest of copypastas to bully trans people into suicide
are now possibly decades old, and i doubt there are many of us who haven't seen them by now,
though admittedly, the hate is getting way more personalised.

this is especially the case now, with the absolutely *extreme* rise in transphobia
and ostracization of trans people, trans women especially, from society.
honestly, a visit to the front page of any social media is all it takes to realise how many people out there
despise trans people and are WILLING to try and destroy their lives if they hold the power to do so,
and they are not just politicans or [famous but god-awful British fiction authors.](https://www.vox.com/culture/23622610/jk-rowling-transphobic-statements-timeline-history-controversy)

it is breathtaking how cruel remarks against trans people that used to be isolated to awful
people on and off the internet have been transformed into popular rhetoric meant to dehumanise the entirety of trans people.
hearing awful remarks about how you're never going to be a real woman or man used to be reserved to be said by
your parents, relatives or terrible people on the internet, but it is now broadcast, in some places every evening,
on the telly for millions of people to see and inherit as language of their own. what was once seen as extremely
mean and clear bullying, is now considered a standard part of "fact-based" political discussion.
and i don't think many of us even realise the magnitude of this change.
i know i didn't until i started writing this.

this rhetoric is now weaponised against trans people to suppress them in all forms.
awful accusations are brought up against them for the sole purpose of social isolation and now legal
discrimination. years ago it was unthinkable that queer people could be arrested for walking into the
"wrong" bathroom, and even the now most violent oppressors tried to hold up the fa√ßade that they
stood in support of the LGBT community. remember that picture of Trump [holding a rainbow flag upside down](https://qz.com/823649/donald-trump-unfurled-a-rainbow-flag-with-lgbt-written-on-it-at-a-rally-in-greeley-colorado-to-express-his-so-called-support), grinning?
he even went as far as to say that trans people were free to use [any bathroom they choose](https://time.com/5595474/donald-trump-roll-back-transgender-protections/).
obviously, that rhetoric has now completely swung the other way around.

now, while i personally don't really have many skeletons in my closet (but one for halloween),
just the thought that a person i've had
something in common with in the past but crossed their path at some point or another
could leverage information about my queer identity against me terrifies me.

and any accusations don't even have to be true, because of course they don't.
cruel, hateful narratives against queer people (and trans women especially)
are now awfully the norm. accusations of pedophilia, sexual assault, abuse, and other things are no longer
accusations that are brought up against real and actually dangerous offenders, they're used to target and destroy
the lives of innocent queer people. 

and the worst part probably being that if you're unfortunate enough to come from a country or society
where queer people are ostracized and isolated, unwelcome in society, or worse, face legal punishment for
merely existing, chances are any such accusations will stick like gum to a blanket.

all of this is beyond awful, unequivocally cruel, and utterly evil.

i have absolutely no empathy for people that engage in pushing these blatantly false narratives,
and quite frankly believe that the protection of queer people should currently be a much higher priority
than engaging in and trying to dispel these obvious falsehoods.
this cannot be won with rational argument, because it is not rational, and more than that, it's actively dangerous.
it's like trying to argue with the person holding a knife at your throat.

for what it's worth, this is also why i've installed such strict rules on my Discord server regarding this
very thing. at this point in my life, after everything i've been through and what i've been told,
i can take a couple of hateful spears into my chest,
but that doesn't mean others should have to too. us with brains not [infected by mould](https://www.distractify.com/p/jk-rowling-black-mold) should try
our best to create safe spaces for queer people (and other vulnerable groups) to exist in,
without fear of hate or attacks against them.

if you've made it this far, i have one last nugget of thought i want to share.

whether you're an admin of a Discord server with 20,000 members or simply a friend of a trans person,
please stand up for them. put your foot down for them. speak out for them.

there are people out there who are vulnerable, and you never know when the last poisoned arrow they
can take will come.

and you can never know when will yours.
